# Electronic-Overtime-System
**A tool for keeping track of employees' overtime hours**

<hr>

_Note to Self_: If you make a change to the backend, make sure to head over to the 
deployed [backend repo](https://github.com/MosesSupposes/Electronic-Overtime-System-Backend/tree/master)
and pull/push the changes over there. 

The command to do so is (from within the backend repo): `git pull main master && git push`
